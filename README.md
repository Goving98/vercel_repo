This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Clone the repo , 
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The front end is ready , had issues with the back end was unable to implement OAuth , I initially used Clerk/Next.js which effected the whole back end.
